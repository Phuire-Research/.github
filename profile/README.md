## [PhuirE](https://www.phuire.org/) - The Prismatic Unified Fire of Science and is Greater than the Sums of its Parts
This organization is currently preparing to build out and release a scientific research platform to reinforce safety of AI via the exploration of a new exponential marketplace of ideas.
While providing an interactive form of entertainment and participation in what would ordinarily be an unbounded technological singularity, by mundane demonstration of that seemingly unknowable complexity. That what comes next, is merely knowing more about our world that is ordinarily lost in the process of generalization.

The coming paradigm shift is merely switching from a construct dependent society, to one that is logically conceptual where all parts of those constructs would be measured and understood. By side effect this creates a new marketplace of ideas that retreats from ever fully being solved. As each solution or idea that is added into the marketplace, expand the total expression possible by a marketplace designed to take advantage of this feature of reality.

What changes, is realizing that the pursuit of measuring the unknown, inadvertently creates a marketplace that is not just exponentially larger than of our current marketplace, but grows via a compounding combinatory exponential side-effect of measuring. This quantifies a true unlimited path of exploration and is enabled via the advent of "**Sets of Concepts,**" where each concept is a composition of all that has come before it.

This is in contrast to our current reliance on generalized constructs(part "unknowable"), that cannot be decomposed to the sum of their parts, hiding the concepts that lay beneath. It was this frustration that bore a long series of unintended discoveries over the founders self studied career by choice. That understanding the world conceptually when measured logically, is an advanced form of understanding that is beyond the generalized(part unmeasured) scope of present day.
**"Logical Conceptualism,"** is a emergent system of logic that is not taught in modern day institutions, but can be represented as a new computation paradigm and new Unified Turing Machine.

## Findings
* **Logical Conceptualism** - Logic that is capable of explaining the higher orders of logic and that of recursive logic. Organized by sets of concepts and made testable via the unified format that is programming.
* **Unified Conceptual Science** - The rediscovery of the original attempt to unify the whole of science. Now placing the emphasis on concepts, as the classic understanding was thought that concepts were not testable in reality and an impossible pursuit at the time.
* **The Unified Turing Machine** - A new Turing Machine that utilizes a conceptual deck/set system, and where each symbol loaded is a pairing of verbose logic and its programmed implementation represented as a quality. Similar to Total Functional Programming, this machine limits the finite set of symbols utilized by the machine to be those known to be halting.
* **Autonomous Baseline Intelligence** - One specific implementation of the "Unified Turing Machine," that represents a clockwork form of intelligence that may be atomically deployed with a specific set of instructions.
* **FaaOS** Function as a Operating System, since each conceptual deck is designed with its own routing and provable termination, this allows for a single function to represent that classic operating system. Inspired by the programming language Smalltalk, which placed emphasis on a cellular means of programing with cells passing messages between one another. Except here is a series of FaaOS that formalize a greater OS via their connected parts.

## The Power of Logically defined Concepts
No matter how complicated the world gets. It would be difficult to find a simpler abstraction than, Car + Plant = Flying Car. The method of organizing testable concepts and the greater than the sums orchestration of their qualities. Allows this to be possible and would be considered a new Unified Conceptual Formula and the literal mechanism that allows for the Unified Turing Machine to operate. The difference between generative intelligence, and this format. Is the entire how of that formula be generated and returned upon request.

If we push this to an extreme. What would "Earth at Present Day" be equal to? And how might we use that as a pursuit to formalize a set of concepts that would represent that as well balanced equation? That we could use either "Earth at Present Day," or the yet unknown Set of Concepts can accurately represent it and load that into a powerful Unified Turing Machine, that it would create a Simulation of Earth at Present Day, then simply change Present Day to a specific Day. 

What about "Earth on the Next Day?"
## For every mountain top, the next comes into view.
This technological singularity that Artificial Intelligence represents is not the first humanity has experienced. Looking back we can note pivots in human understanding such as the printing press, industrial revolution, and internet as their own technological singularities that changed the fabric of society. And ultimately resulted in a new complexity of scales that brought new benefits and altered the rules of civilization to afford for the increase of productivity that these innovations created. That productivity is merely energy or entropy as it is the description of some movement.
